	Hi there, I'm Karen!
</h1>
<h2>
	I am a graphic designer based in New York.
</h2>

<p>
	I spend most days planning and designing (websites, apps of all shapes and sizes, identities, marketing campaign and print/web ads). Having worked with a wide variety of clients ranging between local businesses, start-up entrepreneurs, major gaming and hospitality business, international developer community and a university, I believe that great user centered design can change how we interact and emphasize with the world around us.
</p>

<p>
	I earned my BA in Advertising from Michigan State University(Go Green!), where I went on to study graphic design. As an avid learner, I also took graphic design course at School of Visual Art and User Experience Design course at General Assembly. When I am not designing, you can find me trying new restaurants, spending time with friends and family, going to shows, traveling or exploring the city.
